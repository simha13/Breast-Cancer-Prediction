# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
A personal Machine Learning model that predicts the likelihood of breast cancer based on various features extracted from health data

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of breast cancer based on various health-related features. The model is designed to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention.

# Features
*Datasets:* The model has been trained on two different datasets:
1) SKLearn Breast Cancer Dataset
2) Breast Cancer Prediction Dataset (taken from [https://www.kaggle.com/iammustafatz](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sajidsaifi/prostate-cancer))

*Algorithms:* The model has been trained on Logistic Regression for the two aforementioned datasets with slightly varying results.

*Evaluation:* The model's performance has been evaluated using the Accuracy Score and the algorithm shows slightly differing accuracies, thus showing its versatility.

# Results
1) For the SKLearn dataset, it is observed that Logistic Regression obtains the best accuracy score of 92.98% on testing data.
2) For the other dataset however, one can notice enormous improvements in accuracy, achieving an accuracy score of 97.37% on testing dataset.
